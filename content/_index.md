        My research focuses on understanding climate change impacts on ecosystems and land-use systems, particularly in regions that are highly vulnerable to climate extremes.
        Having directly observed and experienced climate-related challenges, I am motivated to contribute to research that connects real-world impacts with quantitative
        and modelling-based approaches.

        I work across climate and ecosystem modelling, biosphere–atmosphere interactions, remote sensing, and data-driven environmental analysis.
        I actively welcome collaborative research opportunities and interdisciplinary projects where my background and skills can contribute meaningfully to ongoing
        or emerging research on climate impacts, ecosystem resilience, and adaptation.
