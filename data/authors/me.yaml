role: Climate & Ecosystem Modelling | Biosphere–Atmosphere Interactions | Land-Use Change

bio: |
  I am interested in climate change adaptation and ecosystem responses to environmental stress,
  with a background in climate and ecosystem modelling, biosphere–atmosphere interactions,
  and land-use change. My research focuses on improving photosynthesis and gross primary
  productivity (GPP) estimation in terrestrial biosphere models using observational
  constraints such as chlorophyll fluorescence.
